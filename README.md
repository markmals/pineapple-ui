# Pineapple UI üçç

A work-in-progress React & Preact UI component library built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html) and [`@preact/signals-react`](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/tree/main/packages/react), with APIs similar to [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), and styled like a combination of macOS, iOS, and Windows 11.
